    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer : MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that provides high scalability, performance, and flexibility. It uses a flexible data model based on documents, which allows for easy storage and retrieval of data in various formats, including unstructured and semi-structured data. MongoDB is a popular choice for building modern, data-driven applications that require the handling of large volumes of data.\n",

    "Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use a traditional relational data model. They provide a flexible data model that allows for the storage and retrieval of data in various formats, including semi-structured and unstructured data, and they typically provide high scalability, performance, and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Large volumes of data: MongoDB is optimized for handling large volumes of data and provides high scalability, making it a good choice for applications that need to handle large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible data models: MongoDB's document-based data model allows for flexible storage of data in various formats, including semi-structured and unstructured data, making it a good choice for applications that require this type of flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile development: MongoDB is well-suited for agile development methodologies as it provides flexibility in data modeling and can easily accommodate changes to data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time analytics: MongoDB supports real-time analytics and reporting, making it a good choice for applications that require real-time data processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud-native applications: MongoDB is designed for cloud-native applications and provides built-in support for containerization, orchestration, and deployment in cloud environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MongoDB is a popular choice for building modern, data-driven applications that require handling of large volumes of data, have flexible data models, and need to be developed using agile methodologies."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer :  MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that provides a wide range of features. Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-based data model: MongoDB uses a document-based data model to store data, which is highly flexible and allows for the storage of data in various formats, including semi-structured and unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data with ease. It provides built-in support for sharding and replication, which allows for horizontal scaling of data across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "High availability: MongoDB provides automatic failover and replication, ensuring that data is always available and accessible even in the event of hardware or software failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible querying and indexing: MongoDB supports flexible querying and indexing of data, allowing for fast and efficient retrieval of data based on complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation and real-time analytics: MongoDB provides support for aggregation and real-time analytics, allowing for complex data processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-sharding and load balancing: MongoDB automatically manages data distribution and load balancing across multiple servers, making it easy to scale applications as data volumes grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich query language: MongoDB provides a rich query language that supports advanced query features such as ad-hoc queries, indexing, sorting, and projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial queries: MongoDB provides built-in support for geospatial queries, allowing for easy storage and retrieval of location-based data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich driver and tool ecosystem: MongoDB has a rich driver and tool ecosystem, making it easy to integrate with popular programming languages and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-level atomic operations: MongoDB supports document-level atomic operations, ensuring that data remains consistent and accurate even in the event of concurrent writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MongoDB provides a flexible, scalable, and highly available NoSQL database solution that is optimized for modern, data-driven applications. Its document-based data model, rich query language, and flexible indexing and querying make it a popular choice for building complex applications that require the handling of large volumes of data."
