    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: In programming, when you open a file, you create a connection between the file and the program. This connection consumes system resources, including memory and processor time. The close() function is used to terminate this connection and release those resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to close a file after you've finished using it for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevent data loss: If you don't close a file after writing to it, the data may not be saved properly, leading to potential data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Free system resources: As mentioned earlier, an open file connection consumes system resources. Failing to close a file can lead to resource leaks, which can cause your program to slow down or even crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allow other programs to access the file: If you keep a file open, other programs may not be able to access it. By closing the file, you release the lock on the file, allowing other programs to access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure data integrity: When you close a file, the operating system writes any data still in the program's buffer to the file. This ensures that the file contains all the data you wrote to it and that the data is in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, it's important to always close a file after you've finished using it to prevent data loss, free system resources, allow other programs to access the file, and ensure data integrity."
